### Greetings! 
My name is Rafał and I am a 20 yo programming enthusiast based in Poland. I study at Warsaw School of Economics and work as risk analyst. 
My journey within programming began somewhere in 2019 when I have decided to finally find out what it really is having borrowed a Python book from my girlfriend's father - since this time Python had to become my programming language of choice. My main field is data science & business intelligence in which I look forward for further development, but I am also interested in other IT branches.

Repositories on which I worked the most are pinned.
