### Greetings! 
My name is Rafał and I am a 20 yo programming enthusiast based in Poland. 

My journey within programming began somewhere in 2019 when I have decided to finally find out what it really is borrowing a Python book from my girlfriend's father.

I am also a student at Warsaw School of Economics where I gained insights in data analysis, statistics, econometrics and finance and a risk analyst intern in investment bank.

All combined, my main field is data science in which I look forward for further development, but I am also interested in other IT branches.

I have a good knowledge of Python, SQL and R and am also quite proficient in Excel and VBA.

My Github contains both academic (Projects-from-studies-) and non-academic projects (My-little-projects) that I have created in a meantime and I hope somebody finds them useful and/or interesting.

In a spare time I am a musician - both artist and the producer - playing in a doom metal band and dark ambient project.
