### Greetings! 
My name is Rafa≈Ç and I am a 21 yo programming enthusiast based in Poland. My journey within IT & programming began somewhere in 2019 when I have decided to finally find out what it really is having borrowed a Python book. My main fields are data science & business intelligence in which I look forward for further development, but I am also interested in other IT branches.

Repositories on which I worked the most are pinned.
